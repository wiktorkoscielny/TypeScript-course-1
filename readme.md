## General info
I have just started learning TypeScript.
As always, I use online resources, so I used the beginner's course in this case. 
With it, I created a todo application. Extensive notes are included in the 'Notes.txt' file.

Generally this repository is made to come back to it in next 
projects using TypeScript and to refresh knowledge.

## Technologies
Project is created with:

* TypeScript
* HTML
* CSS

## Setup
The application were activated by Live Server extension for VSC

## Sources
This app is based on:
